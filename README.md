#  Police Data Analysis

The project explores the analysis of policing data from the Center for Policing Equity (CPE) dataset, focusing on incidents, use of force, complaints, and other relevant information. The aim was to evaluate police policies' effectiveness, identify patterns and trends in policing, and assess the impact of police actions on the community.

# Key Achievements
Conducted comprehensive data analysis on a dataset with 2384 observations and 47 variables.<br/>
Transformed character data into numeric format for effective analysis.<br/>
Developed various visualizations to illustrate patterns in police interactions, including race-based analysis and use of force incidents.<br/>
# Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of police policies and procedures.<br/>
To identify patterns and trends in policing.<br/>
To assess the impact of police actions on the community.<br/>
# Technologies Used
R programming for data analysis and visualisation.<br/>
Various R packages including ggplot2 for creating visualisations.
# Key Findings
Black subjects were disproportionately represented in police interactions across all officer races, followed by White and Hispanic subjects.<br/>
A weak positive linear relationship was observed between the number of use-of-force incidents and the officer's years of experience.<br/>
Most officers did not sustain injuries during incidents, with a significant majority reporting no injuries.<br/>
The distribution of officers across divisions and by gender was visualized, revealing disparities in gender representation.
# Conclusions
The analysis highlighted significant racial disparities in police interactions.<br/>
The weak correlation between officer experience and use-of-force incidents suggests other factors may influence these incidents.<br/>
Gender distribution among officers varied significantly across different divisions.
# Implications
The findings can inform policy changes aimed at reducing racial disparities in policing.<br/>
Further research could explore additional factors influencing the use of force by police officers.<br/>
Insights from the gender distribution analysis could guide recruitment and training programs to promote diversity within the police force.
